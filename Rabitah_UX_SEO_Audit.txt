--------------------------------
SECTION: Hero (Homepage /)

ISSUES:
- Value proposition is strong but generic; it doesn’t clearly differentiate Rabitah (e.g., Telegram Mini Apps/bots, end-to-end delivery, measurable outcomes).
- Two equal CTAs compete (“Start Your Project” and “View Our Work”), weakening the primary action.
- Stats (150+, 50+, 5+) are unqualified (what counts as a project/client?) and feel like vanity metrics without a credibility anchor.
- “Digital Agency” label is generic and doesn’t include a keyword-rich positioning line.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
Build and ship digital products that scale

H2:
Web apps, mobile apps, and Telegram Mini Apps—designed and engineered for speed, reliability, and conversion.

BODY TEXT:
Rabitah is a remote-first product team for founders and growing companies. We take you from concept to launch, then iterate with clear priorities and measurable outcomes.

CTA:
Book a discovery call

NOTES:
- Keep one primary button (above), and make “View case studies” a secondary text link to reduce CTA competition.
- Add one proof line under the CTA: “Trusted by 50+ teams • 150+ launches since 2019” (or replace with accurate proof you can defend).
- Consider a short “Best for” line to reduce ambiguity: “Best for: MVPs, redesigns, and scaling existing products.”
--------------------------------
SECTION: Services (Homepage /)

ISSUES:
- Heading “Services” is too broad; doesn’t signal outcomes or key service keywords.
- Descriptions are decent but could be tighter and more benefit-led (less “what we do”, more “what you get”).
- No primary CTA for this section, which is a missed conversion moment for visitors not ready to scroll further.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Hero)

H2:
Digital product development services

BODY TEXT:
Choose a lane—or let us scope the fastest path to launch. We design, build, and optimize products that are easy to use, fast to load, and ready to scale.

CTA:
Explore all services

NOTES:
- Rename the small label from “WHAT WE DO” to “SERVICES” (cleaner) or “HOW WE HELP” (more human).
- Keep each service description to one sentence. Lead with outcome, then capability.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Tech Stack (Homepage /)

ISSUES:
- “Our Stack” is not value-led; it reads like a list rather than a reason to trust delivery quality.
- No framing for why these technologies matter (speed, maintainability, hiring, stability).
- No CTA for visitors who want reassurance about implementation approach.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Hero)

H2:
Modern stack. Production-ready delivery.

BODY TEXT:
We use proven technologies that keep products fast, secure, and maintainable. That means fewer bugs, faster iterations, and lower long-term costs.

CTA:
See how we deliver (process)

NOTES:
- Add one credibility line under the heading: “React/Next.js • React Native/Flutter • Node/Python • Postgres • CI/CD”.
- If you keep categories (Frontend/Backend/Mobile/DevOps), add one short “why it matters” line per category (e.g., “Frontend: fast UX and SEO-friendly rendering”).
--------------------------------
SECTION: Why Choose Us (Homepage /)

ISSUES:
- Micro-label “WHY NEXUS” is a brand error and reduces trust immediately.
- Benefits are good but feel generic; no specificity (what “fast delivery” means, what “support” includes).
- No CTA; this section should convert hesitant users with a next step.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Hero)

H2:
Why teams choose Rabitah

BODY TEXT:
You get senior execution with a simple process: clear scope, weekly progress, and a product that’s stable at launch. No surprises. No “black box” delivery.

CTA:
Start with a project scope call

NOTES:
- Update the label to “WHY RABITAH” or remove it entirely.
- Add one proof point per card when possible (e.g., “Typical MVP launch: 4–8 weeks”).
- Keep 4–5 reasons max; prioritize outcomes over traits.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Portfolio (Homepage /)

ISSUES:
- “Portfolio” is fine, but “Selected work / case studies” is stronger for conversion and SEO intent.
- “View Project” is a dead-end if projects don’t have detail pages; it should either link to case studies or be removed.
- Outcomes are present (“3x conversion increase”, “100K+ downloads”) but lack context (what changed? timeframe?).

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Hero)

H2:
Selected work and outcomes

BODY TEXT:
A few examples of products we’ve designed and built—focused on performance, usability, and real business results.

CTA:
View all work

NOTES:
- If you don’t have case study pages, change “View Project” to “Request a similar build” (links to Contact) or remove the button and rely on the section CTA.
- For each project, add a single “Problem → Solution → Outcome” line to make scanning faster.
--------------------------------
SECTION: About (Homepage /)

ISSUES:
- “We’re a Team of Builders” is strong, but the copy repeats ideas found elsewhere and lacks a clear differentiator.
- “No fluff” is good, but it’s still abstract—add what that means in practice (scope discipline, measurable milestones).
- Approach bullets are good but could be more concrete and benefit-led.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Hero)

H2:
A senior team for product execution

BODY TEXT:
We’re a remote-first team that builds products with a clear point of view: ship what matters, measure what works, and keep the codebase clean. From MVPs to rewrites, we partner closely with your team to reduce risk and speed up delivery.

CTA:
Learn how we work

NOTES:
- Replace “Founded in 2019…” paragraph with one credibility line plus industries served (keep it short).
- Consider adding one “Who we work with” micro-list: “Startups • SaaS • Fintech • E-commerce • Communities”.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Contact (Homepage /)

ISSUES:
- Headline is friendly but generic; it doesn’t set expectations (response time, what info to send, what happens next).
- Contact details elsewhere are inconsistent (Rabitah vs Nexus); this undermines trust.
- Form CTA “Send Message” is okay but could be more outcome-oriented.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Hero)

H2:
Tell us what you’re building

BODY TEXT:
Share your goals, timeline, and must-have features. We’ll reply within 1 business day with next steps and a clear plan.

CTA:
Send project details

NOTES:
- Add 3 quick helper bullets near the form: “Goal • Deadline • Budget range (optional)”.
- Ensure email + Telegram handle match the Footer and brand (use Rabitah everywhere).
--------------------------------
SECTION: Footer (Homepage /)

ISSUES:
- Brand message is good but could be tighter and more specific to core offerings.
- Social links currently look like placeholders (generic GitHub/LinkedIn/Twitter URLs) which can reduce trust.
- Contact info is inconsistent across the site (Footer uses Rabitah; Contact page uses Nexus).
- Privacy/Terms links exist but pages/routes may not; broken links hurt trust and SEO.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Hero)

H2:
(Not used in this section)

BODY TEXT:
Rabitah builds web apps, mobile apps, and Telegram Mini Apps for teams that need speed without cutting corners. Remote-first. Worldwide.

CTA:
Get a project estimate

NOTES:
- Use real social URLs only; remove any you can’t support yet.
- Standardize contact to one email and one Telegram handle across all pages.
- SEO note: update site meta title/description to match positioning (e.g., “Rabitah | Digital Product Development Agency”) and keep a unique description per route where possible.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Hero (Services Page /services)

ISSUES:
- H1 “Services” is too generic; it misses high-intent keywords.
- No short positioning paragraph to guide which service to pick.
- The section lacks a primary CTA for visitors who already know what they want.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
Digital product development services

H2:
Design, engineering, and growth support—shipped with a clear process.

BODY TEXT:
From MVP builds to complex integrations, we help teams launch faster and scale with confidence. Choose a service below, or contact us for a tailored scope.

CTA:
Request a quote

NOTES:
- Keep “WHAT WE DO” as a smaller label only if it adds clarity; otherwise remove.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Services List (Services Page /services)

ISSUES:
- Card intros truncate descriptions (“slice(0, 100)…”), which can cut sentences awkwardly and reduce clarity.
- Titles are all-caps in data; all-caps reduces readability and feels less premium.
- No guidance on “best for” per service, which would reduce decision friction.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Services Hero)

H2:
Choose the right service

BODY TEXT:
Each service includes a clear scope, timeline, and deliverables. If you’re unsure, we’ll recommend the fastest path to launch after a short discovery call.

CTA:
Compare timelines and starting budgets

NOTES:
- Add a one-line “Best for” per service (e.g., “Best for: MVP launches, marketing sites, SaaS rebuilds”).
- Use Title Case service names for readability.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Footer (Services Page /services)

ISSUES:
- Footer is present, but the CTA could be more aligned to services intent (quote/scope).

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Services Hero)

H2:
(Not used in this section)

BODY TEXT:
Talk to Rabitah about your timeline, scope, and success metrics. We’ll recommend an approach that fits your team and budget.

CTA:
Get a services quote

NOTES:
- Ensure the same email/Telegram is used across the site.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Hero (Service Detail Page /services/:slug)

ISSUES:
- Service title is all-caps in data; readability and premium tone suffer.
- Subtitle/description are feature-heavy; they should lead with outcomes and “who it’s for”.
- No immediate next-step CTA above the fold; service pages should convert.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
[Service name in Title Case]

H2:
[Outcome-led subtitle, e.g., “Fast, scalable builds with SEO-ready foundations.”]

BODY TEXT:
We deliver a clear scope, weekly progress, and production-ready quality. Expect a product that loads fast, stays stable, and is easy to maintain as you grow.

CTA:
Get a quote for this service

NOTES:
- Add one short “Best for” line under the subtitle (e.g., “Best for: MVPs, redesigns, performance fixes, scaling.”).
--------------------------------
SECTION: What's Included (Service Detail Page /services/:slug)

ISSUES:
- “What’s Included” list is helpful but lacks grouping; long lists are harder to scan.
- Items are phrased inconsistently (mix of nouns and phrases).
- No CTA at the end of the list for high-intent users.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Service Hero)

H2:
What’s included

BODY TEXT:
You get the essentials for a strong launch—product UX, engineering, and the foundations for performance and growth.

CTA:
Ask for a scope checklist

NOTES:
- Group features under 3–4 mini headings (H3): “Product & UX”, “Engineering”, “Performance & SEO”, “Analytics & Handoff”.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Our Process (Service Detail Page /services/:slug)

ISSUES:
- Process is solid but generic; doesn’t communicate what the client receives at each step.
- “Design & Prototyping” appears in multiple services; align naming to one consistent process.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Service Hero)

H2:
A simple process that keeps you in control

BODY TEXT:
Each step ends with a clear deliverable—so you always know what’s done, what’s next, and what decisions you need to make.

CTA:
See a sample timeline

NOTES:
- For each step, add one “Deliverable” line (e.g., “Discovery: scope + milestones”, “Design: clickable prototype”, “Build: staging releases”, “Launch: QA + deployment plan”).
--------------------------------
SECTION: Timeline & Pricing (Service Detail Page /services/:slug)

ISSUES:
- “Starting at” can feel salesy without context; users need what influences pricing.
- Timeline and pricing are strong conversion content but lack a next step.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Service Hero)

H2:
Timeline and starting budget

BODY TEXT:
We price based on scope, complexity, and speed. After a short call, you’ll receive a clear estimate with milestones and deliverables.

CTA:
Get an estimate

NOTES:
- Add a short line: “Includes: design (if needed), development, QA, launch support.”
- Add “Optional add-ons” list to reduce uncertainty (e.g., ongoing support, growth experiments, content/SEO).
--------------------------------
SECTION: CTA (Service Detail Page /services/:slug)

ISSUES:
- CTA copy is generic (“something amazing”); it should match service intent and reduce friction.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Service Hero)

H2:
Let’s scope this in one call

BODY TEXT:
Tell us what you’re building and your target date. We’ll propose the fastest path to launch, plus options if you want to phase the work.

CTA:
Book a service call

NOTES:
- Add microcopy under the button: “Reply in 1 business day.”
--------------------------------
SECTION: Prev/Next Navigation (Service Detail Page /services/:slug)

ISSUES:
- “Previous/Next” is functional but not descriptive; add clarity for scanning.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Service Hero)

H2:
(Not used in this section)

BODY TEXT:
Explore related services that often pair well with this work (e.g., UI/UX + Web Development, Growth + Landing Page optimization).

CTA:
View all services

NOTES:
- Consider replacing “Previous/Next” with “Related services” for intent alignment.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Footer (Service Detail Page /services/:slug)

- Footer is present; ensure service pages keep the same contact info as the rest of the site.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:

BODY TEXT:
Ready to move? Share your requirements and we’ll respond with a clear plan and estimate.

CTA:
Contact Rabitah

NOTES:
- Keep all brand mentions as Rabitah (avoid any “Nexus” leftovers).
--------------------------------
SECTION: Hero (Work Page /work)

ISSUES:
- H1 “OUR WORK” is loud but not descriptive; “Case studies” / “Work” with outcomes reads more premium and SEO-friendly.
- Intro is good but could be more specific (what type of work, what outcomes).
- No immediate CTA for visitors who like what they see.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
Case studies and product launches

H2:
Real builds. Real outcomes.

BODY TEXT:
Explore selected web, mobile, and Telegram products we’ve shipped—from MVPs to mature platforms. Each case study focuses on the problem, the solution, and measurable results.

CTA:
Start a project brief

NOTES:
- Consider adding 3 quick filters that match buyer intent: “MVP”, “Scale-up”, “Telegram”, “E-commerce”, “Fintech”.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Filters (Work Page /work)

ISSUES:
- Filter labels (“WEB APP”, “TELEGRAM”) are fine, but could be clearer and more human.
- No instructional microcopy (“Filter by platform”).

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Work Hero)

H2:
Filter by platform

BODY TEXT:
Choose a category to quickly find relevant work.

CTA:
View all case studies

NOTES:
- Use Title Case: “Web Apps”, “Telegram”, “All”.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Projects Grid (Work Page /work)

ISSUES:
- Project descriptions are far too long for scanning; they read like full articles.
- Titles have inconsistent capitalization (“Product-Showcase PLATFORM”).
- Missing a consistent structure (Problem / Solution / Result), which hurts clarity and conversion.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Work Hero)

H2:
Selected projects

BODY TEXT:
For each project card, use the same 3-line structure:
1) What it is (one sentence)
2) What we built (one sentence)
3) Outcome (one metric if available)

Example card copy (replace current long paragraphs):
- Mansarda Fakro (Web platform)
  A product showcase platform for architectural projects and inspiration.
  Built a fast, searchable experience with performance and SEO in mind.
  Outcome: Improved discovery and lead quality.

- Street.rf (Commercial listings)
  A marketplace for renting and selling commercial spaces.
  Built filtering, inquiry capture, and broker workflows for high-intent leads.
  Outcome: Faster inquiries and better broker matching.

- DITKURS.ru (Education content)
  A content platform for exploring IT careers and course comparisons.
  Built a scalable publishing experience with clear navigation and search.
  Outcome: Higher engagement on key guides.

- Telegram Planeton (Telegram Mini App)
  A Telegram clicker game with rewards and on-chain payments.
  Built a Mini App UX with secure integrations and analytics.
  Outcome: Higher retention and recurring activity.

CTA:
Request a similar build

NOTES:
- Keep “Tech” and “Year” but add “Outcome” as the first item users see.
- Use consistent location phrasing (or remove location if it doesn’t add trust).
--------------------------------
SECTION: CTA (Work Page /work)

ISSUES:
- CTA is good but generic; it can be more specific about next step and response time.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Work Hero)

H2:
Want results like these?

BODY TEXT:
Send your goals and target date. We’ll reply within 1 business day with next steps and a recommended approach.

CTA:
Get in touch

NOTES:
- Use a button-style CTA for clarity (not only an underlined text link).
--------------------------------
SECTION: Footer (missing) (Work Page /work)

ISSUES:
- No footer means fewer trust signals, fewer internal links, and fewer conversion paths at the end of the page.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Work Hero)

H2:
(Not used in this section)

BODY TEXT:
Rabitah builds web apps, mobile apps, and Telegram Mini Apps for teams that need speed without cutting corners.

CTA:
Get a project estimate

NOTES:
- Add the global footer to this route for consistency and SEO internal linking.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Hero (About Page /about)

ISSUES:
- H1 repeats the homepage message; About should add credibility and differentiation (team, principles, ways of working).
- Copy is good but still abstract; add how you work and what clients can expect.
- Missing a clear CTA for high-intent visitors.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
A product team built for shipping

H2:

BODY TEXT:

NOTES:
- Add one short credibility line: “150+ projects shipped since 2019” (only if accurate).
--------------------------------
SECTION: Approach (About Page /about)

ISSUES:
- Approach steps are solid but generic; clarify the client benefit and output of each stage.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from About Hero)

H2:
How we work

BODY TEXT:
We keep delivery simple and transparent:
- Understand: align on goals, users, constraints, and success metrics
- Build: ship in weekly increments with clear priorities
- Improve: measure, iterate, and keep performance high

CTA:
Book a discovery call

NOTES:
- Rename the mini headings to verbs for clarity: “Align”, “Ship”, “Optimize”.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Company Stats (About Page /about)

ISSUES:
- Stats are good but should reinforce trust (what “projects” means, what industries).

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from About Hero)

H2:
Proof you can trust

BODY TEXT:
150+ launches across SaaS, fintech, e-commerce, and community products. Remote-first team working across time zones.

NOTES:
- If possible, add 2–3 client logo slots or short testimonials near stats (no fluff, just outcomes).

NOTES:
- Keep contact info consistent (Rabitah email + Telegram handle).
--------------------------------
SECTION: Hero (Contact Page /contact)

ISSUES:
- Good headline, but it’s generic; add what happens next and what to include.
- Brand inconsistency risk: the page currently references “Nexus” contact info in multiple places on the site.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
Talk to Rabitah

H2:
Tell us your goal. We’ll reply within 1 business day.

BODY TEXT:
Share what you’re building, your target date, and any constraints. We’ll come back with a recommended plan and a clear estimate.

CTA:
Send a project brief

NOTES:
- Standardize contact details everywhere (use one Rabitah email + one Telegram handle).
--------------------------------
SECTION: Contact Methods (Contact Page /contact)

ISSUES:
- Email/Telegram currently reference “nexus” in some places; this is a critical trust issue.
- No reassurance about privacy/next steps.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Contact Hero)

H2:
Contact details

BODY TEXT:
Email us for detailed requests, or message on Telegram for quick questions. We respond within 1 business day.

CTA:

NOTES:
- Use the same email as the footer (e.g., hello@rabitah.com) and the same Telegram handle.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Contact Form (Contact Page /contact)

ISSUES:
- “Subject” placeholder (“Project inquiry”) is generic; guide users toward better inputs.
- Form CTA is neutral; make it outcome-led.
- Missing microcopy about response time and what’s next.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Contact Hero)

H2:

Prefer a quick call? We can scope the first version in 20 minutes.

CTA:
Book a discovery call

NOTES:
- Keep footer CTA as a secondary option if the form already dominates.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Hero (Blog Page /blog)

ISSUES:
- Blog positioning is off-brand: it focuses on architecture/design, while the company is a digital agency—hurts topical authority and conversion.
- Categories (“SUSTAINABILITY”, “DESIGN”, “URBAN PLANNING”) don’t match buyer intent for digital services.
- No CTA to connect reading to contacting or subscribing with a clear value promise.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
Product, UX, and engineering insights

H2:
Practical guidance for building, launching, and scaling digital products.

BODY TEXT:
Short, opinionated posts from Rabitah—covering product strategy, UI/UX, development, Telegram Mini Apps, and growth.

CTA:
Subscribe for updates

NOTES:
- If you keep the existing architecture articles, create a separate category hub and clearly explain why it belongs on this brand; otherwise replace content to match agency expertise.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Filters (Blog Page /blog)

ISSUES:
- Current categories don’t align with services; filtering doesn’t help users find relevant expertise.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Blog Hero)

H2:
Browse by topic

BODY TEXT:
Pick a topic to find posts relevant to your build and launch stage.

CTA:
See all posts

NOTES:
- Recommended categories: “Product Strategy”, “UX/UI”, “Web Development”, “Mobile”, “Telegram”, “Growth”.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Posts Grid (Blog Page /blog)

ISSUES:
- “READ MORE” is generic; consider a more specific action (“Read article”).
- Excerpts are long and abstract; make them more tactical and benefit-led.
- Author roles should match the agency (not “Architect & Writer” unless intentional).

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Blog Hero)

H2:
Latest articles

BODY TEXT:
Each post should answer one clear question and include practical takeaways. Keep titles specific and outcome-led.

CTA:
Read the latest post

NOTES:
- Use title patterns that match search intent, e.g.:
  - “How to scope an MVP in 60 minutes (with a checklist)”
  - “Telegram Mini Apps: what to build first for retention”
  - “Landing page UX fixes that improve conversions”
--------------------------------
SECTION: Newsletter (Blog Page /blog)

ISSUES:

- No trust microcopy (no spam, unsubscribe anytime).

RECOMMENDED TEXT:

H2:
Get one useful idea each month

BODY TEXT:
No fluff. One short email with product, UX, and engineering insights you can apply immediately. Unsubscribe anytime.

CTA:

NOTES:
- Add microcopy under the button: “No spam. Unsubscribe anytime.”
--------------------------------

CTA:

NOTES:
- Add the global footer to reinforce brand and provide conversion paths.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Hero (Blog Post Page /blog/:id)

ISSUES:
- Risk of multiple H1s: the article renderer turns markdown “# ” into H1 inside the content, which can create more than one H1 on the page.
- Post content topics are currently architecture-centric; they dilute agency topical authority.
- Author role (“Architect & Writer”) may not match the brand and can confuse readers.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
[Post title: specific, outcome-led]

H2:
[One-sentence promise of what the reader will learn]

BODY TEXT:
This article covers the key decisions, pitfalls, and a practical checklist—so you can move faster with fewer mistakes.

CTA:
Get a scope checklist

NOTES:
- Heading rule: keep only the page title as H1. Convert in-article headings to H2/H3.
- Add one short “Want help?” callout at the end of the article (links to Contact).
--------------------------------
SECTION: Featured Image (Blog Post Page /blog/:id)

ISSUES:
- Images are fine but need descriptive alt text that matches the post topic (not just the title).

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Blog Post Hero)

H2:
(Not used in this section)

BODY TEXT:
Alt text pattern: describe what’s shown and why it matters (e.g., “Wireframe of onboarding flow showing 3-step signup”).

CTA:
(Not used in this section)

NOTES:
- Keep alt text short and descriptive; avoid stuffing keywords.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Article Content (Blog Post Page /blog/:id)

ISSUES:
- Current content is long-form and well-written, but mismatched to the agency positioning.
- In-article headings can be improved for scannability (shorter, more specific).
- Missing “key takeaways” summary to help skimmers.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
H1:
(Use page H1 from Blog Post Hero)

H2:
Key takeaways

BODY TEXT:
Add a short summary block near the top:
- What to do first
- What to avoid
- What success looks like

CTA:
Ask a question about your project

NOTES:
- Use short sections with clear subheads (H3). Keep paragraphs under 3 lines where possible.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Author Block (Blog Post Page /blog/:id)

ISSUES:
- Author role is generic and may not match brand expertise.
- No credibility line (what they do, what they’ve shipped).

RECOMMENDED TEXT:

H2:
About the author

BODY TEXT:
[Author name] is part of Rabitah’s product team, working across UX, engineering, and delivery. Focus: shipping usable products with measurable outcomes.

CTA:
Work with Rabitah

NOTES:
- Keep it short; one line of credibility is enough.
--------------------------------
SECTION: Related Posts (Blog Post Page /blog/:id)

ISSUES:
- “Related Articles” is fine, but it should keep readers within a clear topic journey (UX → build → launch).

SECTION: Hero (404 Page)

ISSUES:
- Current 404 is visually inconsistent with the rest of the site (different typography and color system).
- Copy is generic and doesn’t help users recover with useful paths (Services, Work, Contact).
- Missed opportunity to convert lost visitors.

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
